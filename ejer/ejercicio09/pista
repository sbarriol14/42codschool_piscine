I'll try to give you some hints so you can solve your HW yourself.

Follow this steps:

read the manual of file by executing man file.
Then try it out by file somefile and see what happens
Try to run file on different file types
By now you should be able to understand how to find out if some file is a jpeg image or not.
now read the manual for find (or use google to find out how to use it to find all files in some directory and all subdirectories)
now find out how to use -exec option of find in order to connect it with previously used file command
Now you should be able to find out the filetypes of all files in needed directory and list them
Now read about pipes | and grep command to find out how to filter only for JPEG files.


find / -exec file {} \; | grep "JFIF"
